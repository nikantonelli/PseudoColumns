PseudoColumns
=========================

## Overview
Use a text field to hold a number of required bits of information and then show them in a tabular format.

I have made it use a field that you can choose (e.g. “Notes”) through the App settings. You can also set the Titles through the app settings and then ask the app to “reset” the chosen field to contain the titles, e.g:

The owner of the portfolio item can fill in the details in the Editable Details Page and then it can be viewed through a summary report in the app, e.g, if you add text like this:

![alt text](https://github.com/nikantonelli/PseudoColumns/blob/master/Images/image2.png)

The app can then show a summary that looks like this:

You can reset the chosen field through the gear icon:

You can set the field and the (number of) titles through the app settings for your page or your team via a shared page:
